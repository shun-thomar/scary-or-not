# About
Basically, what the title says. You're presented with a movie poster and you have the option to rate is as "Scary" or "
Not Scary" or get another random movie poster if you'd like to skip the one currently displayed.

# Technical stuff
The client side is provided by Vue 3, helped with Bulma for styling.
You can review the corresponding [Github Project](https://github.com/users/shun-thomar/projects/5).
As I'm doing everything on my own, it is still evolving and subject to tinkering.

# Screenshot(s)
As of today, 2022-08-24, this is what the app looks like as a mockup.
